The Password Strength Tester is a Python-based application designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and check if they have been compromised in known data breaches. The project combines password strength analysis with a basic hash-checking mechanism to ensure users create secure and unique passwords.

The application features:

    Password Strength Evaluation:

        Analyzes password length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

        Provides a strength rating: Weak, Strong, or Very Strong.

    Hash Checking:

        Compares the password's MD5 hash against a dictionary of common hashes (e.g., "password", "123456").

        Alerts the user if the password is found in the hash list.

    User-Friendly Interface:

        Built with tkinter, the application provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface for users to input passwords and view results.

Key Features:

    Password Strength Analysis: Evaluates passwords based on industry-standard criteria.

    Hash Checking: Detects commonly used or compromised passwords.

    Graphical Interface: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction.

    Extensible Design: The code is modular and can be expanded with additional features.
