# Password-Strength-Tester
The Password Strength Tester is a simple Tkinter-based GUI application that evaluates password strength based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It also checks if the password matches common weak passwords using MD5 hashing. The tool provides real-time feedback to help users create stronger.
